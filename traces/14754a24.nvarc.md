<rules_summary>
Transform '4' into '2' if it is vertically or horizontally adjacent to a '5'.
</rules_summary>
<input_generation>
Input grids of varying sizes are provided. The transformation maintains relationships between input and output dimensions.
</input_generation>
<solution_steps>
1. Iterate through each cell of the input grid.
2. If a cell contains the value '4', check its immediate horizontal and vertical neighbors.
3. If any horizontal or vertical neighbor contains the value '5', change the current cell's value to '2' in the output grid. Otherwise, retain the original '4'.
4. If a cell does not contain '4', copy its value directly to the output grid.
</solution_steps>
<key_insight>
Both input and output grids have identical dimensions.
