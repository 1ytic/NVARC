<rules_summary>
Replace a rectangular area around each '1' in the input with '1's in the output, while keeping other values unchanged.
</rules_summary>
<input_generation>
Input grids are provided as examples. The transformation rule must be inferred from the training examples.
</input_generation>
<solution_steps>
1. Locate all '1' values in the input grid.
2. For each '1', define a rectangular region centered around the '1'.
3. Fill the defined rectangular regions with '1's in the output grid.
4. Retain all other values from the input grid in the output grid.
</solution_steps>
<key_insight>
The location of '1' values remains the same between input and output.
