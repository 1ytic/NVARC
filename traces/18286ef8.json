    "The grids contain horizontal lines of zeros.",
    "Non-zero numbers appear above and below the zero lines.",
    "The central column between the zero-filled areas changes in some rows.",
    "Some numbers in the central column are updated according to their position.",
    "Other numbers remain in their original positions.",
    "If the original number is not 9, and it is flanked by numbers other than 0, then the number may become 9."

  "hypotheses": [
    "The central column is transformed, potentially based on proximity to other specific numbers and row number.",
    "The central column may undergo a transformation such that some non-zero numbers are replaced by 9 if they are flanked by other non-zero numbers above the zero line."

  "rejected_hypotheses": [
    {
      "hypothesis": "The central column values are simply inverted modulo 10.",
      "reason": "The digit '8' remains an '8' in some cases, violating the inversion hypothesis."
