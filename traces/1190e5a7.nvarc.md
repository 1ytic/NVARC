<rules_summary>
The output is a subgrid using only the values that are the most frequent in the input grid and removing any rows that contain other values.
</rules_summary>
<input_generation>
Input grids are provided as examples. The transformation rule must be inferred from the training examples.
</input_generation>
<solution_steps>
1. Identify the most frequent value in the input grid.
2. Create an output grid using only rows containing the most frequent value.
3. Create an output grid by extracting the rows from the input matrix which contain the most common values.
4. Output the resulting grid.
</solution_steps>
<key_insight>
The central rows/columns of the input grid contain a single distinct value.
