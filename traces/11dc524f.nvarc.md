<rules_summary>
Move a group of same numbers in the input to another location in the output, depending on the shape of the non-7s in the input. Shift bottom-left groups up and top-middle groups down.
</rules_summary>
<input_generation>
Input grids of varying sizes are provided. The transformation maintains relationships between input and output dimensions.
</input_generation>
<solution_steps>
1. Identify the locations of groups of non-7 numbers in the input grid.
2. If the non-7 numbers are in the bottom-left, move the block to the top by maintaining the relative position. If the non-7 numbers are in the top-middle, move the block to the middle by maintaining the relative position. Maintain the block.
3. Leave the rest of the output grid as 7.
