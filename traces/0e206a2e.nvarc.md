<rules_summary>
Non-zero value groups are moved based on a learned vector field derived from the input's structure.
</rules_summary>
<input_generation>
Input grids are provided as examples. The transformation rule must be inferred from the training examples.
</input_generation>
<solution_steps>
1. Identify all contiguous groups of non-zero cells.
2. Determine a vector field based on the input grid.
3. Move each group according to the local vector field value.
</solution_steps>
<key_insight>
There are groups of contiguous non-zero cells in the input that are shifted.
