    "Objects of the same color tend to cluster together.",
    "The locations of the colored objects shift slightly between input and output, suggesting a translation or movement.",
    "The shapes and colors of the objects are preserved.",
    "The relative positions of the objects to each other is roughly maintained, suggesting a shifting of entire patterns.",
    "Objects of the same color appear to move as a connected unit."

    "The colored shapes shift diagonally or orthogonally by a small offset.",

      "hypothesis": "The colored shapes are mirrored along the horizontal or vertical axis.",
      "reason": "Mirroring would change the relative positions of the colored blocks, but they are preserved in the examples."

      "hypothesis": "The colored shapes are rotated by 90 or 180 degrees.",
      "reason": "Rotation changes the orientation of the blocks, which is not observed in the training examples."
