<rules_summary>
Divide the output into 3x3 blocks. Assign the highest value to blocks corresponding to a '5' in the first row, the middle value to blocks corresponding to a '5' in the second row, and the lowest value to blocks corresponding to a '5' in the third row.

<solution_steps>
1. Divide the input grid into rows.
2. For each row, identify positions containing the digit 5.
3. For each row, generate a corresponding value for each location within that row. Highest value for row 1, middle value for row 2, and lowest value for row 3.
4. Create a 3x3 grid, where each cell represents a block. Fill the blocks with the values derived from the locations of '5' within their corresponding row.
5. Fill each output block with the determined value.
