<rules_summary>
The output grid replicates the values surrounding the central column's elements to fill each row, while keeping the '1' values in the central column intact.
</rules_summary>
<input_generation>
Input grids of varying sizes are provided. The transformation maintains relationships between input and output dimensions.
</input_generation>
<solution_steps>
1. Identify the central column in the input grid.
2. For each row, if the element in the central column is not 1, replicate its neighbor (left or right) across the row.
3. If the element in the central column is 1, retain the values surrounding it from the original input grid row.
4. Assemble the output grid based on these transformed rows.
</solution_steps>
<key_insight>
The central column in the input is transformed in the output.
