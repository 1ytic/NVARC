    "The grid is divided into horizontal bands.",

    "Propagate values horizontally within rows, replacing certain digits based on others in the same row.",
    "If a row contains value 'A' at column x and value 'B' at column y, then replace intermediate values in columns between x and y with 'B'.",

      "hypothesis": "Replace the value between two different numbers with the right number",
      "reason": "Example 3 shows that '3' overwrites '0', but '2' overwrites '0' as well, suggesting the right number may spread to intermediate locations only when intermediate locations are zeroes."
