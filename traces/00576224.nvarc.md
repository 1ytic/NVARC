<rules_summary>
The output is constructed by creating a 3x3 grid of blocks, each the size of the input. The blocks in the top and bottom rows of this larger grid are direct copies of the input grid. The blocks in the middle row are horizontally flipped copies of the input grid.
</rules_summary>
<input_generation>
Input grids of varying sizes are provided. The transformation maintains relationships between input and output dimensions.
</input_generation>
<solution_steps>
1. Let the input grid be `I`.
2. Create a new grid `I_flipped` by horizontally flipping `I` (reversing the order of its columns).
3. Construct a 3x3 grid of blocks.
4. Place three copies of `I` in the first row of blocks.
5. Place three copies of `I_flipped` in the second row of blocks.
6. Place three copies of `I` in the third row of blocks.
7. Combine the nine blocks into the final output grid.
</solution_steps>
<key_insight>
The output grid's dimensions are three times the input grid's dimensions in both height and width.
