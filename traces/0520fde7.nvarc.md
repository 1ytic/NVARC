<input_generation>
Input grids are provided as examples. The transformation rule must be inferred from the training examples.
</input_generation>
<solution_steps>
1. Find the column of 5s in the input grid.
2. For each 5, check its diagonal neighbors.
3. Create a 3x3 output grid.
4. If a diagonal neighbor of a 5 is a 1, put a 2 in corresponding position of output grid. Otherwise put a 0.
</solution_steps>
<key_insight>
