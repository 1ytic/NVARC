<rules_summary>
The output is a 7x7 grid constructed by identifying and repositioning specific configurations of 2s from the input.
</rules_summary>
<input_generation>
Input grids of varying sizes are provided. The transformation maintains relationships between input and output dimensions.
</input_generation>
<solution_steps>
1. Initialize a 7x7 output grid with zeros.
2. Identify locations of the value 2 in the input grid.
3. Based on the position of the 2s in the input, populate the output grid with 2s, rearranging them according to a specific pattern.
4. Leave remaining cells in the output grid as 0.
</solution_steps>
<key_insight>
The input grid is larger than the output grid.
