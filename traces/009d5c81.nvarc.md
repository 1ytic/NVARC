<rules_summary>
The transformation identifies two objects: a 'target' of color 8 and a 'key' of color 1. The shape of the key object determines the new color for the target object based on a shape-to-digit mapping. Specifically, a shape resembling a '7' maps to color 7, a '3' maps to color 3, and a '+' maps to color 2. The final output is created by recoloring the target object and removing the key object from the grid.

<input_generation>
Input grids contain colored cells. The transformation operates on color patterns and relationships.

<solution_steps>
1. Identify the group of connected cells with color 1 (the 'key object').
2. Identify the group of connected cells with color 8 (the 'target object').
3. Recognize the shape of the key object.
4. Determine the new color for the target object by mapping the key object's shape to a color: '7'-shape -> 7, '3'-shape -> 3, '+'-shape -> 2.
5. Create a copy of the input grid.
6. In the copied grid, replace all cells with color 8 with the new color determined in the previous step.
7. In the copied grid, replace all cells with color 1 with the background color 0.
</solution_steps>
<key_insight>
Each input grid contains two objects with non-background colors: one is always color 8 and the other is always color 1.
