    "The grids are square.",
    "The central row and column contain a single repeated value.",
    "Other values are arranged symmetrically with respect to central row/column.",
    "The repeated value extends to the top and bottom rows, and the leftmost and rightmost columns.",
    "Some non-repeated values are moved to positions horizontally or vertically adjacent to their original position."

  "hypotheses": [
    "The output grid copies the input grid except for cells horizontally and vertically adjacent to non-zero values, which are set to non-zero values based on proximity.",
    "The central row and column use the same value. Other cells are copied directly or replaced based on local neighbor values, exhibiting symmetry.",
    "The central row and column use the same value. Other cells copy input value unless a value other than zero is located one cell to the left/right/above/below; if so, replace the cell with that non-zero value."

    "If there is a non-zero neighbor, set the output cell to the value of that neighbor. If there are multiple non-zero neighbors, select one of them to define output value.",
