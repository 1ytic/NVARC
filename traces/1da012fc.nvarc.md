<rules_summary>
The rule involves replacing specific digits with other digits based on their local arrangement within the grid. Digit replacements in the top left and bottom right have independent transformation rules.
</rules_summary>
<input_generation>
Input grids are provided as examples. The transformation rule must be inferred from the training examples.
</input_generation>
<solution_steps>
1. Identify the areas of the grid where digit replacements occur (top left and bottom right).
2. For the top left region, apply digit replacement rules: 1 becomes 2, 2 becomes 2, and combinations of 2 transform into combinations of 2 in the corresponding output region.
3. For the bottom right region, apply digit replacement rules: 1 becomes 6, 3 becomes 3, 4 becomes 3, 5 becomes 5, 6 becomes 3, and 8 becomes 3.
4. Keep the 0 digits unchanged.
</solution_steps>
<key_insight>
The output contains a similar structure to the input, with transformations happening in areas containing specific digits.
