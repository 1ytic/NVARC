<rules_summary>
The output grid is identical to the input grid except the non-4 values are shifted down by N rows, wrapping around.
</rules_summary>
<input_generation>
Input grids of varying sizes are provided. The transformation maintains relationships between input and output dimensions.
</input_generation>
<solution_steps>
1. Identify non-4 values in the input grid.
2. Shift those non-4 values down by N rows, wrapping to the top of the grid if necessary.
3. Populate the output grid with these shifted values; keep 4 values in all other locations.
</solution_steps>
<key_insight>
The input and output grids have the same dimensions.
