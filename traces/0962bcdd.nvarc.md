<rules_summary>
Replace each non-zero value 'x' in the input with a pattern of non-zero values in the output, using the values adjacent to 'x' and 'x' itself. A '2' becomes surrounded by '7', a '3' becomes surrounded by '4'. A '6' becomes surrounded by '8'.
</rules_summary>
<input_generation>
Input grids are provided as examples. The transformation rule must be inferred from the training examples.
</input_generation>
<solution_steps>
1. Identify non-zero elements in the input grid.
2. For each non-zero element, replace it and its neighbors with values as seen in training examples where 'x' becomes surrounded.
</solution_steps>
<key_insight>
The central non-zero element in the input is replaced by other non-zero elements in the output.
