    "The input and output grids have the same dimensions.",
    "The corners in the input grid propagate inwards in the output grid.",

    "The pattern of 0s and 5s near the edges of the input grid is often retained in the output.",

  "hypotheses": [
    "The pattern extends numbers from the corners, with some 0's changing to 1's and 2's in the middle.",
    "Values near the outer edges of the input grid remain the same while values closer to the center are altered based on their position relative to the edges.",
    "The values are transformed according to a fixed template that is consistent across all examples, adding noise in the central empty regions."
