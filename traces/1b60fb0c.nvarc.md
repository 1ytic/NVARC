</rules_summary>
<input_generation>
Input grids are provided as examples. The transformation rule must be inferred from the training examples.
</input_generation>
<solution_steps>
1. Identify the region of 1's.
2. For each 0 adjacent to a 1, check if it is connected to the outer boundary.
3. If the 0 is not connected to the outer boundary, change it to a 2.
</solution_steps>
<key_insight>
