    "The rule involves replacing specific digits with other digits based on their local arrangement within the grid. Digit replacements in the top left and bottom right have independent transformation rules.",

    "For the bottom right region, apply digit replacement rules: 1 becomes 6, 3 becomes 3, 4 becomes 3, 5 becomes 5, 6 becomes 3, and 8 becomes 3.",
