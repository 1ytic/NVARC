<rules_summary>
The output grid is generated based on a transformation centered around the location of the number 1 or 4 in the input grid.
</rules_summary>
<input_generation>
Input grids of varying sizes are provided. The transformation maintains relationships between input and output dimensions.
</input_generation>
<solution_steps>
1. Locate all instances of the number 1 and 4 in the input grid.
2. For each instance, apply a transformation to the neighboring cells according to the training examples.
3. Preserve other cells from the input grid.
</solution_steps>
<key_insight>
