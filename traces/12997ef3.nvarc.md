<rules_summary>
The output consists of the minimum bounding box of the non-zero input values, where the non-zero values are expanded to form a 3x3 block of the same value, cropping blocks that extend past valid indices.
</rules_summary>
<input_generation>
Input grids of varying sizes are provided. The transformation maintains relationships between input and output dimensions.
</input_generation>
<solution_steps>
1. Find the minimum bounding box containing all non-zero values in the input grid.
2. For each non-zero value within the bounding box, create a 3x3 block of the same value.
3. Crop the 3x3 blocks that extend outside the bounding box.
4. Place the resulting blocks into the output grid.
