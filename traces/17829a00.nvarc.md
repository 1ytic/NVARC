</rules_summary>
<input_generation>
Input grids are provided as examples. The transformation rule must be inferred from the training examples.
</input_generation>
<solution_steps>
1. Identify the dominant exterior value.
2. Replace specific instances of that value with another value, corresponding to positions observed in the training examples.
3. Keep the remaining values as they are in the input.
</solution_steps>
<key_insight>
