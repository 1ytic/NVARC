<rules_summary>
The output is generated by cyclically shifting the non-zero values within each row.
</rules_summary>
<input_generation>
Input grids of varying sizes are provided. The transformation maintains relationships between input and output dimensions.
</input_generation>
<solution_steps>
1. For each row in the input grid, identify the non-zero values.
2. Cyclically shift the non-zero values in each row to the left or right, maintaining the same relative order.
3. Place the shifted non-zero values back into the original positions within the row.
</solution_steps>
<key_insight>
