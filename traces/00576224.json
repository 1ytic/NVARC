    "The output grid's dimensions are three times the input grid's dimensions in both height and width.",

      "reason": "In Example 1, the input is [[7, 9], [4, 3]]. A vertical flip would produce [[4, 3], [7, 9]]. The middle block in the output is [[9, 7], [3, 4]], which is a horizontal flip, not a vertical one."
