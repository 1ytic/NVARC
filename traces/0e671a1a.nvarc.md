<rules_summary>
The output is generated by copying the input and filling the space between the non-zero numbers with the number 5, drawing horizontal and vertical lines.
</rules_summary>
<input_generation>
Input grids of varying sizes are provided. The transformation maintains relationships between input and output dimensions.
</input_generation>
<solution_steps>
1. Copy the input grid to the output grid.
2. For each non-zero number in the input grid, fill all empty cells to the left and right of the number with 5 until another non-zero number or the boundary is reached.
3. For each non-zero number in the input grid, fill all empty cells above and below the number with 5 until another non-zero number or the boundary is reached.
</solution_steps>
<key_insight>
