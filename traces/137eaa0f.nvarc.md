<rules_summary>
The output grid contains only clusters of non-zero values from the input, ordered by their topmost row.
</rules_summary>
<input_generation>
Input grids of varying sizes are provided. The transformation maintains relationships between input and output dimensions.
</input_generation>
<solution_steps>
1. Identify all non-zero clusters in the input grid.
2. Determine the minimum bounding box encompassing each cluster.
3. Order the clusters by their topmost row position in the input grid.
4. Construct the output grid by placing the bounding boxes of the clusters in the identified order.
