<rules_summary>
Each non-zero number is moved to a new location in the grid, potentially shifting pairs of 5s together. Numbers with same value tend to cluster together.
</rules_summary>
<input_generation>
Input grids of varying sizes are provided. The transformation maintains relationships between input and output dimensions.
</input_generation>
<solution_steps>
1. Identify all non-zero numbers in the input grid.
2. Move each non-zero number to a new location, trying to keep 5s as pairs.
3. Fill the remaining spaces with 0s.
</solution_steps>
<key_insight>
The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.
