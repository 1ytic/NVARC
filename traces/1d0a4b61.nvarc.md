<rules_summary>
The central section is filled with a modified version of the input pattern and when there is a zero nearby, propagate that to the corresponding pattern cells nearby.
</rules_summary>
<input_generation>
Input grids of varying sizes are provided. The transformation maintains relationships between input and output dimensions.
</input_generation>
<solution_steps>
1. Copy the border rows and columns from the input to the output.
2. For each cell within the central area, copy the corresponding pattern.
3. When there is a zero nearby, the pattern propagates that to the non-edge section of the output, and copy those patterns into corresponding blocks.
4. Assign zeroes into the specific regions in patterns with zero cells in the input.
</solution_steps>
<key_insight>
Input and output grids have the same dimensions.
