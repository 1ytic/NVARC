<rules_summary>
Shift all the numbers towards the bottom right as far as they can go without changing their order. If there are multiple possible solutions, favor one where they are on the bottom rows before on the rightmost columns.
</rules_summary>
<input_generation>
Input grids of varying sizes are provided. The transformation maintains relationships between input and output dimensions.
</input_generation>
<solution_steps>
1. Iterate through the input grid from left to right and top to bottom.
2. Create an empty output grid with the same dimensions as the input grid.
3. Place the non-zero numbers from the input grid to the bottom right cells of the output grid respecting their relative order, shifting zeros to the top and left.
</solution_steps>
<key_insight>
