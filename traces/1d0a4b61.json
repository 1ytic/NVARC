    "Input and output grids have the same dimensions.",
    "The top and bottom rows remain unchanged.",
    "The first and last columns remain unchanged.",
    "The central areas are transformed patterns.",

  "hypotheses": [
    "The central section is a horizontally repeating pattern with zeroed cells affecting adjacent pattern cells.",
    "The central section mirrors the input pattern within a confined area, with a transformation based on whether there is a zero cell nearby.",

    {
      "hypothesis": "The central section mirrors the input pattern within a confined area.",
      "reason": "This fails to explain the transformed patterns near the zeroes in example 1 and 2."
    },
    {
      "hypothesis": "The central section repeats a single pattern based on dimensions of non-zero components.",
      "reason": "This fails when the zero cells are added; the pattern is disrupted significantly, beyond simply a scaled or tiling pattern."

    "For each cell within the central area, copy the corresponding pattern.",
    "When there is a zero nearby, the pattern propagates that to the non-edge section of the output, and copy those patterns into corresponding blocks.",
