<rules_summary>
Reflect non-zero values across the horizontal center of the grid, leaving zero values unchanged.
</rules_summary>
<input_generation>
Input grids of varying sizes are provided. The transformation maintains relationships between input and output dimensions.
</input_generation>
<solution_steps>
1. Iterate through each cell of the input grid.
2. If the cell value is non-zero, calculate the corresponding cell position across the horizontal center.
3. Copy the non-zero value from the input cell to the reflected cell in the output grid.
4. If the cell value is zero, copy it directly to the corresponding cell in the output grid.
</solution_steps>
<key_insight>
The input and output grids have the same dimensions.
