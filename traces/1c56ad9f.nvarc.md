<rules_summary>
The output is generated by reflecting the central non-zero pattern across both horizontal and vertical axes.
</rules_summary>
<input_generation>
Input grids contain shapes or patterns. The transformation modifies these patterns according to specific rules.
</input_generation>
<solution_steps>
1. Identify the central non-zero pattern in the input grid.
2. Reflect this pattern horizontally.
3. Reflect this pattern vertically.
4. Combine the original pattern with its horizontal and vertical reflections to form the output grid. All other cells are zero.
</solution_steps>
<key_insight>
The central non-zero region in the input is mirrored in the output.
