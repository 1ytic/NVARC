<rules_summary>
The output grid contains the same non-zero numbers as the input grid, plus potentially sums of those numbers, placed at different locations.
</rules_summary>
<input_generation>
Input grids are provided as examples. The transformation rule must be inferred from the training examples.
</input_generation>
<solution_steps>
1. Identify the non-zero numbers in the input grid.
2. Calculate the sum of all identified non-zero numbers.
3. Include all the identified non-zero numbers and their sum in the output grid, placed at different locations, if the sum is new.
</solution_steps>
<key_insight>
The non-zero numbers in the input appear in the output, but their positions might change.
