<solution_steps>
1. Identify all rows and columns in the input grid that contain at least one non-zero element.
2. Determine the minimum and maximum row and column indices from the identified rows and columns.
3. Create a new grid using the row and column range identified in the previous step.
4. Populate the new grid with the values from the input grid within the specified row and column range.
