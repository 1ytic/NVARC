<rules_summary>
The output grid is constructed by creating a larger grid that is 3 times the size of the input in both dimensions. This larger grid is treated as a meta-grid with the same dimensions as the input. For each cell (r, c) in the input grid, if its color is not black (0), the corresponding block at (r, c) in the output meta-grid is a copy of the entire input grid. If the color is black, the corresponding block is a solid black grid of the same size as the input.

<input_generation>
Input grids of varying sizes are provided. The transformation maintains relationships between input and output dimensions.

<solution_steps>
1. Determine the height (H) and width (W) of the input grid.
2. Create a new output grid of size (3*H) x (3*W), initialized with black (0).
3. Iterate through each cell of the input grid at row `r` and column `c`.
4. Check the color of the input cell `input[r][c]`.
5. If the color is not black (0), copy the entire input grid into the output grid starting at position `(r*H, c*W)`.
6. If the color is black (0), the corresponding block in the output grid remains black (as it was initialized).
</solution_steps>
<key_insight>
The output grid dimensions are exactly 3 times the input grid dimensions in both height and width.
