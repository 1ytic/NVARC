    "Shift columns containing the sequence '0, 3' downwards, while preserving existing '5' values. The column shift leaves other values untouched.",
    "Identify columns with '3' and '0' and shift the values within those columns downward, except for '5' which remains fixed. The remaining values fill from the top.",
    "For columns containing the sequence '0,3', move the '3' value to align with any '5' value in that same column, shifting '0' accordingly. Other values are untouched."

    {
      "hypothesis": "Shift entire columns downwards if they contain '3', with the '0' filling the empty top space.",
      "reason": "This approach fails when a '5' is present in the column; the 5 should not be moved."

    {
      "hypothesis": "If a column contains a '3', replace all other values with '7'.",
