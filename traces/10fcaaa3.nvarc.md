<rules_summary>
The output is generated by tiling 2x2 blocks. If the corresponding input cell has a non-zero value, that value occupies the same relative position within the block. Otherwise, the output positions are populated with a combination of 0 and 8.
</rules_summary>
<input_generation>
Input grids of varying sizes are provided. The transformation maintains relationships between input and output dimensions.
</input_generation>
<solution_steps>
1. Determine the dimensions of the input grid.
2. Create an output grid with proportional dimensions to the input grid.
3. Iterate through each cell of the input grid.
4. For non-zero values, copy the input value to the corresponding location in a 2x2 block within the output grid.
5. Fill remaining spaces in the 2x2 output blocks with 0s or 8s based on the position of the zero in the original input.
6. If the original input value is zero, put 8 in the first and third positions, and 0 elsewhere in the new block.
