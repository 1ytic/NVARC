    "The input is a 3x3 grid containing a color and zeros.",
    "The output is a 9x9 grid, which can be seen as a 3x3 tiling of 3x3 blocks.",
    "Each 3x3 block in the output corresponds to a cell in the input grid.",
    "If an input cell (i, j) has a non-zero value, the corresponding 3x3 block in the output (from row 3i to 3i+2 and column 3j to 3j+2) is an exact copy of the entire 3x3 input grid.",

    "The output is generated by replacing every non-zero pixel in the 3x3 input with the 3x3 input grid itself, and replacing every zero pixel with a 3x3 block of zeros.",
