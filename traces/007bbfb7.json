    "The output grid dimensions are exactly 3 times the input grid dimensions in both height and width.",

    "Each block in the output grid is either a complete copy of the original input grid or a solid black block of the same size.",
    "The decision to place a copy of the input grid or a black block is determined by the color of the corresponding cell in the input grid.",
