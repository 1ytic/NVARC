<rules_summary>
Divide the grid horizontally by the row of 5s. Above, the first three columns of each row are identical. Below, the last three columns in each row are identical. Values other than 5 in the input are used as a base for the values in the output grid.
</rules_summary>
<input_generation>
Input grids of varying sizes are provided. The transformation maintains relationships between input and output dimensions.

<solution_steps>
1. Locate the row of 5s.
2. For rows above, make the first three columns of each row the same as the first three entries of the first row in that section.
3. For rows below, make the last three columns of each row the same as the last three entries of the last row in that section.
4. Leave the 5s in the original position.
