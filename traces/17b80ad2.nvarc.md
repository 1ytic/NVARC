1. For each column, iterate from top to bottom.
2. If a non-zero value is found, copy that value to all subsequent zero-valued cells in the same column, until the end or until another non-zero value is found.
3. For each column, iterate from bottom to top.
4. If a non-zero value is found, copy that value to all preceding zero-valued cells in the same column, until the top or until another non-zero value is found.
