<solution_steps>
1. Create an output grid with the same height as the input grid and a width of 3.
2. Set the middle column of the output to 0.
3. For each row, check if the corresponding 1 in the input grid is surrounded vertically by 9s.
4. If it is, fill the first and third column of the output grid with 8.
5. Otherwise fill the first and third column of the output grid with 0.
</solution_steps>
<key_insight>
