</rules_summary>
<input_generation>
Input grids of varying sizes are provided. The transformation maintains relationships between input and output dimensions.
</input_generation>
<solution_steps>
1. Identify the locations of 1 and 6 in the input grid.
2. If 6 is horizontally or vertically adjacent to 1, replace the value of 6 with 7 in the corresponding output grid cell.
3. If 1 and 6 are diagonal, then leave values unchanged.
</solution_steps>
