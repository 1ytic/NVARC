    "Shapes composed of the same value expand to nearby regions.",
    "Color value of 1 and 4 appear to be expanding over other colors nearby.",
    "Certain colored regions (e.g., composed of '1' or '4') seem to 'spread' into adjacent areas of different colors.",

  "hypotheses": [
    "Regions of the same color expand outward to encompass neighboring regions of different colors.",
    "Regions expand, prioritizing certain colors like 1 and 4, to the point of forming continuous blocks until colliding with another color region.",
    "Colors change based on proximity to adjacent colors; e.g., a cell adopts the color of the most common adjacent color, possibly favoring 1 and 4.",
    "Regions of color expand, but only in certain areas of the grid."

    {
      "hypothesis": "The grid rotates 90 degrees clockwise and colors are shifted.",
      "reason": "Rotating the input grid in the first training example doesn't produce the output."

      "hypothesis": "Colors are inverted and the grid is horizontally flipped.",
