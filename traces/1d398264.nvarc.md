<input_generation>
Input grids contain shapes or patterns. The transformation modifies these patterns according to specific rules.

<solution_steps>
1. For each non-zero number in the input grid:
2. Determine the pattern or line associated with the number based on its value.
3. Draw that line in the corresponding output grid, starting from the location of the value.
4. Fill the rest of the output grid with zero values.
