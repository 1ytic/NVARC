    "The output repeats or reflects elements from the input at different positions.",
    "The output often features repeated numbers in horizontal or vertical lines.",
    "Non-zero input values seem to propagate to new locations in the output.",
    "The propagation pattern depends on the specific input values and their positions.",
    "Some input values are used to create diagonal patterns in the output.",
    "Zero values generally remain zero in the output, acting as a background.",
    "Adjacent non-zero values can influence the propagation and repetition pattern."
  ],
  "hypotheses": [
    "Input values are propagated to neighboring positions in the output grid, with a weighted average or threshold function determining the new values. Specific weights and threshold change by each color.",
    "Input values are reflected and mirrored across the horizontal and vertical axes, creating symmetrical patterns. The reflection pattern may differ based on the value itself. Some numbers have no reflections, some have repetitions.",
    "The output is generated by applying a convolution filter to the input grid. The filter kernel and stride depend on the color of the input.",
    "Each input value triggers a line in the output grid starting from the value's position. Line orientation (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) and length depend on the specific input value."

    {
      "hypothesis": "Input values are propagated diagonally, with the length of the diagonal determined by the input value itself.",
      "reason": "In Example 2, the '1' does not form a diagonal, but a horitzontal line, mismatching the hypothesis."

    {
      "hypothesis": "The output is created by a simple tiling of the input grid.",
      "reason": "The output in Example 1 has elements that do not exist in the input grid. Also, the output size is not a multiple of the input size."
