<rules_summary>
Objects are reflected across the horizontal and vertical center to generate the output grid.
</rules_summary>
<input_generation>
Input grids are provided as examples. The transformation rule must be inferred from the training examples.
</input_generation>
<solution_steps>
1. For each non-zero object in the input grid, reflect its position across the horizontal center of the grid.
2. Then reflect the resulting position across the vertical center of the grid.
3. Place the object in the reflected position in the output grid.
</solution_steps>
<key_insight>
Objects in the input grid are moved to different positions in the output grid.
