<rules_summary>
Numbers propagate diagonally, overwriting zeros. If two numbers would propagate to the same location, the number encountered first takes precedence. Priority is from top-left to bottom-right
</rules_summary>
<input_generation>
Input grids of varying sizes are provided. The transformation maintains relationships between input and output dimensions.
</input_generation>
<solution_steps>
1. Iterate through the input grid from top-left to bottom-right.
2. For each non-zero number, propagate it diagonally upwards-left, upwards-right, downwards-left, downwards-right until the edge of the grid or until another non-zero number is encountered. If a diagonal propagation encounters an existing number, it stops.
</solution_steps>
<key_insight>
Non-zero numbers in the input propagate to fill empty spaces in the output.
