<rules_summary>
The output is a 3x3 tiling where the input is placed in the center and all other blocks are 0.
</rules_summary>
<input_generation>
Input grids of varying sizes are provided. The transformation maintains relationships between input and output dimensions.
</input_generation>
<solution_steps>
1. Multiply the input grid dimensions by 3 to get the output grid dimensions.
2. Create a grid with the output grid dimensions and fill it with 0s.
3. Place the input grid in the center of the output grid.
</solution_steps>
<key_insight>
Output grid dimensions are exactly 3 times the input grid dimensions.
