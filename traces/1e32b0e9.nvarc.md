<rules_summary>
The central row and column use the same value. Other cells copy input value unless a value other than zero is located one cell to the left/right/above/below; if so, replace the cell with that non-zero value.
</rules_summary>
<input_generation>
Input grids are provided as examples. The transformation rule must be inferred from the training examples.
</input_generation>
<solution_steps>
1. Identify the central row and central column value in the input grid.
2. Copy this value to all positions in the central row and central column in the output grid.
3. For each remaining cell in the output grid, check if the corresponding input cell has a non-zero neighbor (left, right, above, below).
4. If there is a non-zero neighbor, set the output cell to the value of that neighbor. If there are multiple non-zero neighbors, select one of them to define output value.
5. If there are no non-zero neighbors, copy the original input cell value to the output.
