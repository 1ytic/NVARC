<rules_summary>
Replace all 1s with 2s, keep 0s as 0s, and tile the resulting grid 3x3.
</rules_summary>
<input_generation>
Input grids of varying sizes are provided. The transformation maintains relationships between input and output dimensions.
</input_generation>
<solution_steps>
1. Replace each 1 in the input with a 2, leaving 0s as 0s.
2. Tile the resulting grid 3x3 to generate the output.
</solution_steps>
<key_insight>
Output grid dimensions are exactly three times the input dimensions.
