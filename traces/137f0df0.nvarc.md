<rules_summary>
Numbers from the corners extend inwards with a consistent rate. Any 0s in the center are transformed to 1s and 2s in a consistent pattern.
</rules_summary>
<input_generation>
Input grids of varying sizes are provided. The transformation maintains relationships between input and output dimensions.
</input_generation>
<solution_steps>
1. Copy the input grid to the output grid.
2. Extend the numbers from corners inwards.
3. Transform the central 0s to 1s and 2s based on a fixed pattern.
</solution_steps>
<key_insight>
The input and output grids have the same dimensions.
