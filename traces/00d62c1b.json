    "The task involves filling enclosed areas of color 0 (background) with color 4 (yellow), where the boundaries are formed by color 3 (green).",
    "An enclosed area is defined by 0-cells that cannot reach the edge of the grid moving only through other 0-cells in a 4-connected manner (up, down, left, right).",
    "Examples show both single-cell holes and multi-cell rectangular or irregular holes being filled with 4."
  ],
  "hypotheses": [
    "Identify all 0-cells that are not connected to the grid boundary via other 0-cells. Change these 0-cells to 4.",
    "Identify every cell with value 0 that is surrounded by value 3 in its direct 4-neighborhood. Change these cells to 4. (Rejected: Example 3 and 4 show larger areas are filled, not just single cells).",
    "Perform a flood fill from the edges of the grid starting at all 0-cells on the boundary. Any 0-cell not reached by the flood fill and not colored 3 should be colored 4."

    "Scan the input grid to locate all 0-cells that form 'holes' (enclosed spaces).",
    "Use a flood-fill algorithm starting from all boundary 0-cells to mark all 'external' 0-cells.",
    "Any 0-cell that remains unmarked after the flood fill (and is not a 3) is internal/enclosed.",
    "Change the value of these internal 0-cells to 4 in the output grid.",
