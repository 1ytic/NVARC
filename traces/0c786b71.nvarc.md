<rules_summary>
The output grid is generated by repeating the input grid 2x2 times.
</rules_summary>
<input_generation>
Input grids of varying sizes are provided. The transformation maintains relationships between input and output dimensions.
</input_generation>
<solution_steps>
1. Multiply the number of rows in the input by 2 to get the number of rows in the output.
2. Multiply the number of columns in the input by 2 to get the number of columns in the output.
3. Create a new grid with the calculated output dimensions.
4. Repeat the input grid across the rows and columns of the output grid.
</solution_steps>
<key_insight>
Output grid dimensions are exactly 2 times the input dimensions.
