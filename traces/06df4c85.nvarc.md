<rules_summary>
In rows that do not consist of all ones or all of the same number, fill the zeros between nonzero values with the value of the closest nonzero value.
</rules_summary>
<input_generation>
Input grids are provided as examples. The transformation rule must be inferred from the training examples.
</input_generation>
<solution_steps>
1. For each row, check if all the values are the same, or all are ones.
2. If the values are all ones or all the same, copy the row from the input to the output.
3. Otherwise, for each zero in the row, replace it with the closest non-zero number on its left or right.
