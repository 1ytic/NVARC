# Implementation Notes: ARC-AGI-2 LLM Trace Generation

## 1. Branch Structure ✅

**Status**: Clean branch `arc-traces-v2` created from `main`
- Based on commit `c5fcba5` (add developer notes)
- Contains only 5 new files:
  - `arc_trace_generator.py` - Trace generation script
  - `arc_agi2_training_only/arc-agi_training_challenges.json` - Training data
  - `traces/007bbfb7.json` - First trace
  - `traces/00dbd492.json` - Second trace
  - `.gitignore` - Excludes test files and sensitive data
- Ready to merge into `main`

## 2. JSON Structure & NVARC Code Usage

### Current Implementation

**Our Trace Format (Trelis v1 Schema)**:
- Designed for **reasoning quality assessment**
- Captures full reasoning process: observations → hypotheses → rejections → selection
- Fields: `observations`, `hypotheses`, `rejected_hypotheses`, `selected_rule`, `step_plan`, `confidence`

**NVARC Description Format**:
- Designed for **code generation pipeline**
- Fields: `rules_summary`, `input_generation`, `solution_steps`, `key_insight`, `puzzle_concepts`
- Used by `SDG/scripts/` for generating synthetic puzzles

### Alignment Strategy

**Current Status**: 
- ✅ Our generator produces Trelis trace format (good for reasoning assessment)
- ⚠️ Not yet integrated with NVARC's `SDG/` pipeline code
- 📋 Need converter: `trace_to_nvarc_description(trace)` function

**Next Steps**:
1. **Add converter function** to transform Trelis traces → NVARC descriptions
   - Map `selected_rule` → `rules_summary`
   - Map `step_plan` → `solution_steps`
   - Extract `key_insight` from observations
   - Generate `input_generation` from task structure
   - Extract `puzzle_concepts` from observations

2. **Test through NVARC pipeline**:
   - Use converter output with `SDG/scripts/generate_input_grids.py`
   - Use converter output with `SDG/scripts/generate_output_grids.py`
   - Validate generated puzzles match expected transformations

3. **Consider dual-generation**:
   - Option: Generate both formats simultaneously
   - Keep reasoning trace for quality assessment
   - Generate NVARC description for pipeline integration

## 3. Quality Evaluation Framework

### Current Quality Checks (Implemented)

**Structural Quality**:
- ✅ Schema validation (all required fields present)
- ✅ Type validation (observations are strings, not objects)
- ✅ Confidence range [0.7, 0.9] (no overconfidence)
- ✅ At least 2 hypotheses (encourages exploration)
- ✅ Rejected hypotheses have concrete reasons

**Content Quality**:
- ✅ Observations are relational (not example-specific sizes)
- ✅ Observations are atomic and concrete
- ✅ Hypotheses are meaningfully distinct
- ✅ Rejection reasons reference specific mismatches

### Proposed Quality Metrics (To Implement)

**A. Trace Completeness**:
- Do observations cover all key patterns in training examples?
- Are all major transformations captured?
- Is the reasoning chain complete (observations → hypotheses → selection)?

**B. Hypothesis Quality**:
- Are hypotheses genuinely distinct (not paraphrases)?
- Are rejected hypotheses plausible-but-wrong (not obviously wrong)?
- Does selected rule match the step plan?

**C. Generalization Quality**:
- Are observations relational vs absolute?
- Would the rule work on different-sized inputs?
- Is confidence calibrated (not overconfident)?

**D. Cross-Trace Consistency**:
- Similar tasks → similar reasoning patterns?
- Consistent use of terminology?
- No contradictory rules for similar patterns?

**E. Downstream Validation** (NVARC Pipeline):
- Can trace generate valid synthetic puzzles?
- Do generated puzzles match intended transformations?
- Are generated puzzles solvable using the described rule?

### Quality Assessment Plan

**Phase 1: Automated Checks** (Current)
- Schema validation ✅
- Content validation ✅
- Confidence calibration ✅

**Phase 2: Comparative Analysis** (Next)
- Compare LLM traces with human traces (when available)
- Measure overlap in observations
- Measure agreement on selected rules
- Identify systematic differences

**Phase 3: Pipeline Validation** (Future)
- Run traces through reduced NVARC pipeline
- Generate synthetic puzzles from traces
- Validate puzzle quality and solvability
- Measure success rate of code generation

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**:
   - ✅ Clean branch from main (DONE)
   - Add converter function: `trace_to_nvarc_description()`
   - Add quality metrics module: `trace_quality.py`

2. **Short-term**:
   - Test converter output through NVARC pipeline
   - Generate remaining 3 traces (target: 5 total)
   - Implement comparative analysis tools

3. **Medium-term**:
   - Run reduced NVARC pipeline test
   - Compare LLM vs human traces (when available)
   - Refine quality metrics based on results

4. **Long-term**:
   - Full pipeline integration
   - Automated quality scoring
   - Continuous improvement loop
